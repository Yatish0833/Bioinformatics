This is the work I have done during my master's. Bioinformatics website contains code for a webserver made as a project, I never actually got a domain to host this site. Biostatistics folder contains a lot of questionaire based workbooks that shows the knowledge of different topics. The codes for these problems are also visible in workbooks. Perl folder contains a lot of perl codes I have written over time.
